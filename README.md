# Elixir exercises

I like Exercism for learning a new language:
* They write tests, so I can TDD the exercises.
* They let me develop on my own box. I don't have to use some cloud-based scribble thing.
* I can use an IDE, or vim, as I please.
* I can store my code in Git.

I started in summer 2023, then got sidetracked by other things. Now it's a year later, so I'm going to start from the first exercise and work forward from there. That'll happen on a branch called "take-2."

I also realized that IntelliJ, with an Elixir plugin, was too helpful.
I wasn't really learning the syntax because the plugin would write it
for me. So I'm switching to writing in vim, without any Elixir enablement.
